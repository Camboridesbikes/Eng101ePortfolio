			<p><span style="font-weight: 400 ;">Hey there,</span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Cameron Hattendorf and I have an extensive list of skills I&rsquo;m learning to write about! I fix bicycles, build houses and other things, perform with fire, do graphic design and many other great things to make a buck. I enrolled in the English Composition course mainly to improve my professional writing so that I can communicate my skills and experiences, and also to convey that the value in these is worth paying for . Resumes, e-mails, proposals, introductory letters and such, are the main focus of what I have been finding myself writing lately.</span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s all the professional aspect. There is a personal side to all of this as well. In fact, I&rsquo;ve always really enjoyed writing. Sometimes it has helped me through difficult times and tumultuous relationships. Other times writing has allowed me to plan and understand what needed to be done and how to do it. I mean, I use texts and e-mails daily to plan and communicate on multiple scales of time. I&rsquo;d be crazy not to see how becoming a better writer and more effective communicator would improve my quality of life!</span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you read through my projects, I hope you can feel a sense of growth in my writing ability. Gain some insight into my life and the experiences I&rsquo;ve had and will have. Maybe even be inspired to write or do something new for yourself! </span></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I write through my portfolio, I hope to get a sense of who you are. Thee person behind the screen. So that I can relate and create more productive and fulfilling bonds through this medium and any others.</span></p>
